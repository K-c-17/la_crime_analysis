# LA Crime Analysis Project

## üìä Overview

This project explores crime trends in Los Angeles using data visualization techniques powered by **Tableau**. It provides stakeholders‚Äîincluding law enforcement, city officials, and community advocates‚Äîwith clear, data-driven insights into crime patterns from **2020 to 2024**, emphasizing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, demographic patterns, and geographic distribution.

## üß≠ Objectives

The primary goals of this project were to:

* **Identify temporal trends**: Understand how crime rates changed during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
* **Map geographical patterns**: Locate high-crime zones and uncover spatial trends in criminal activity.
* **Analyze demographic disparities**: Examine crime victimization by age, gender, and ethnicity.
* **Evaluate weapon usage**: Discover which crimes most frequently involve weapons.
* **Investigate neighborhood correlations**: Assess if certain types of crime are prevalent in specific areas and whether socioeconomic conditions play a role.

  * Hispanic/Latino and Black communities most affected
  * Central LA is a major hotspot

### 2. **Crime Distribution by Month/Year (Line Chart)**

* Shows monthly crime trends from 2021‚Äì2024
* Sharp decline post-March 2024; unclear seasonality trends

### 3. **Crime Hotspot Map (Gender Overlay)**

* Color-coded by victim gender
* Highlights clustering of male victimization in central/southern LA; female victimization more dispersed

### 4. **Crime by Victim Age (Histogram)**

* Highest crime incidence in the 25‚Äì35 age group
* Different age groups disproportionately affected by specific crimes

### 5. **Day & Time Analysis (Heatmap)**
